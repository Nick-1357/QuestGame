    "1": "To generate the appropriate DTMF signal to represent telephone key number 5, you need to use the corresponding frequency values of the dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) system",
    "3": " In the context of a Fourier series, a negative frequency corresponds to a sinusoidal waveform that is the mirror image of the positive frequency waveform. When we say that a frequency is negative, we mean that the waveform is changing in the opposite direction as compared to its positive frequency counterpart.",
    "6": "To determine if a system is linear and time-invariant (LTI), we need to check if it satisfies the principle of superposition and the time-invariance property. The principle of superposition states that the response to a sum of inputs is the sum of the responses to each individual input, while the time-invariance property states that the system's output to a given input signal remains unchanged over time",
    "7": "the audio samples are stored in the vector xx, and the sample rate is 10,000 Hz (as specified by the time vector tt). To correctly play the audio signal, you should select one of the options provided that correctly specifies the input arguments to the sound function based on the given information.",
    "982": "The discrete-time frequency $\\hat\\omega$ is equal to the continuous-time frequency $\\omega$ normalized by the sampling frequency $f_s$. Therefore, you need to find the answer choice that has the same normalized frequency as the original signal.",
    "1073": "Recall that the Z-transform of a unit delay sequence is $z^{-1}$ and the Z-transform of a Kronecker delta sequence is 1. Therefore, to find the Z-transform of $g[n]$, you can first express $g[n]$ in terms of $h[n]$, use the linearity property of the Z-transform, and then apply the Z-transform of a unit delay.",
    "1081": "Recall that the complex amplitude of a complex exponential signal is the magnitude of the phasor representing the signal. In this case, the phasor can be represented by $e^{j\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$, which has a magnitude of 1. Therefore, to find the complex amplitude $X$, you can simply multiply the amplitude of the cosine signal by $e^{j\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$."
